# AutoCARB for Android

![anteprima](anteprima.png)

This application verifies the carburation (i.e. air-fuel mixture) by means of an analytical model, which takes into consideration simplifying hypothesis.
1. Dynamic effects are neglected, assuming stationary airflow and gasoline flow.
   The dynamic effects are given by the periodic intake of fresh charge operated by each
   cylinder and they are present also in conditions of constant speed and load.
   Gli effetti dinamici sono dati dalla periodica aspirazione di carica fresca operata da       ogni cilindro, il flusso pu√≤ essere instazionario anche in condizioni di regime e carico    costanti.
2. In new software version, the hypothesis of incompressible fluid is used only for gasoline, while air is considered as a perfect gas.
3. Pressure drops and heat exchanges with the walls up to the inlet section of the convergent are neglected.
4. It considers `Cc<Cd`, which are respectively the input speed and the output speed from the main jet.

The mathematical model is mainly based on the nozzle theory, in which the air is considered as an ideal gas subject to adiabatic transformations.
The estimation of the specific heat of the air at constant pressure is computed by means of the "Janaf tables".

The fuel, on the other hand, is considered as an incompressible fluid, although this hypothesis is an approximation, it is consistent with the physical nature of the fluid in question. 
 
As for the distributed losses, the program is able to calculate the friction factor, simulating the Moody diagram in almost a perfect way.
Finally, the head losses (distributed and concentrated) are considered by calculating the efflux coefficient, which in addition provides us with the contribution given by the contraction of the fluid vein. 

To learn more about the gasoline efflux coefficient equation that I used in the model, read the article published on [Matematicamente](https://www.matematicamente.it/forum/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=211382).

As for the coefficient used for air, I refer to the model for compressible fluids and sub-critical motion described and demonstrated in the [article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1243/JMES_JOUR_1960_002_007_02) by Professor S.L.Bragg of the University of Pittsburgh.
